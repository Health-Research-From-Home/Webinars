Welcome to our Health Research From Home Webinars, we will have monthly webinars to share with you the update information from our project.

You can find more details about our Health Research From Home project in this [LINK](https://github.com/Health-Research-From-Home/HealthResearchFromHome).



## [Webinar 1 - Introducing Health Research from Home](./Webinar_1/) 

| Info | Description |
|-|-|
| Speaker | [Professor Will Dixon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-dixon-8686094a/?originalSubdomain=uk), Health Research from Home Lead|
| Speaker Bio| Will is a Professor of Digital Epidemiology at the University of Manchester, an honorary consultant rheumatologist at Salford Royal Hospital, Northern Care Alliance NHS Foundation Trust and Health Research from Home Lead. His research aims to address clinically important questions by analysing data from patient populations, with particular focus on digital health data. This includes the analysis of electronic health record data from GP surgeries and from hospitals (for example, examining the safety of drugs used in rheumatology) and the collection and analysis of data direct from patients using smartphones and wearables. Examples of innovative digital health research include Cloudy with a Chance of Pain, REMORA (Remote Monitoring of RA) and Assembling the Data Jigsaw. Will is the academic co-lead for the Greater Manchester Secure Data Environment (GM SDE). He also chairs the Scientific Advisory Board for Our Future Health and is a member of MRC's Population and Systems Medicine Board and Population Health Sciences Group.|

## Webinar 2 - TBA
	


## Advice Clinics
Alongside each webinar you will have the opportunity to book on to an Information Governance Clinic, a Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement Clinic, and a Tech Clinic to support you as you develop your own smartphone and wearable health research project.

This is your chance to gain unique one-to-one advice with experts in their fields. This unprecedented access will allow you to discuss the specific issues holding your research back and gain practical advice on how to resolve these issues quickly and effectively.

Despite case studies of good success, patient-generated health data research is yet to deliver at scale because of many challenges. We hope that these clinics will help to fill those gaps in knowledge, skill and tools so that we can make the UK a world-leader in this field of research.
