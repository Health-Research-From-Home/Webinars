| Speaker Bio  | Jennifer Quint is a Professor of Respiratory Epidemiology in the School of Public Health at Imperial College London. She is an Honorary Consultant Physician in Respiratory Medicine at both the Royal Brompton Hospital and Imperial College London NHS Foundation Trust. Prof Quint leads the Respiratory Electronic Health Record group, a clinical epidemiology research group whose interests centre on using various sources of de-identified, routinely collected electronic healthcare records to study a number of respiratory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis and COVID-19. Work centres on maximising the quality, linkage and usage of these data for clinical and research purposes. Research topics include understanding the relationship between cardiovascular and respiratory disease, respiratory disease prevention, diagnosis, natural history and management. Many of the outputs are used for informing policy, and in the planning and allocation of resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Learning Tags    | Join us, in our second Health Research from Home webinar, for an in-depth analysis of Verilyâ€™s â€˜Study Watch and Virtual Motor Examâ€™ clinical trial. Living with Parkinsonâ€™s disease can be cruel and painful. Through this trial, Verily worked with patients to find ways to make their journey less difficult. From conception and design, to developing and validating digital measures, to lessons learnt and future opportunities. Our speakers share their experiences of using wearable devices to help inform your future research. <br/>Hereâ€™s what you can expect this webinar to cover: <br/><br/>**Clinical area:**  Parkinsonâ€™s disease <br/><br/>**Data types:** Active tasks and passive sensor data using Verily Study Watch<br/><br/> **Data analysis and modelling:** Digital biomarker development/ validation <br/><br/>Health Research from Home is thrilled to be sharing cutting edge case studies of exemplary work in this emerging field. By learning from each other, our community can go on to create world-leading research that has the power to truly transform peoplesâ€™ lives for the better.                                                                                                                                                |

## Advice Clinics
Alongside each webinar you will have the opportunity to book on to an Information Governance Clinic, a Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement Clinic, and a Tech Clinic to support you as you develop your own smartphone and wearable health research project.

This is your chance to gain unique one-to-one advice with experts in their fields. This unprecedented access will allow you to discuss the specific issues holding your research back and gain practical advice on how to resolve these issues quickly and effectively.

Despite case studies of good success, patient-generated health data research is yet to deliver at scale because of many challenges. We hope that these clinics will help to fill those gaps in knowledge, skill and tools so that we can make the UK a world-leader in this field of research.
