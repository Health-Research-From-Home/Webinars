Nadeem Sarwar and Scott Small will be presenting about their work in the Transformational Prevention Unit (TPU), a scientific and innovative business unit within [Novo Nordisk](https://www.novonordisk.com/partnering-and-open-innovation/transformational-prevention-unit.html). The TPU’s mission is to develop scientific and scalable commercial solutions that prevent obesity and its consequences for people at greatest risk. By combining Novo Nordisk’s scientific insights with clinical data as well as public health data and information, this unit aims to identify people at high risk for developing obesity and deliver targeted interventions that can stop them from developing the disease in the first place. An important principle of the TPU’s work is to build novel, multi-sector partnerships that combine the required scientific, technological and implementation expertise to deliver impactful prevention solutions. Preventing, detecting and managing obesity could be seen as the single most important way to reduce premature deaths due to cancer, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, which are the main causes of death worldwide (Source: World Obesity Atlas 2024). Nadeem Sarwar, Corporate Vice President, is the TPU Head and Co-Founder with a background in scientific and business models encompassing genomics, data sciences and digital technologies for therapeutic and health innovation.

| Overview      | In our seventh webinar, we are handing the reigns over to our colleagues at the University of Manchester, Professor John Ainsworth and Dr James Cunningham. <br/>In this webinar Professor Ainsworth and Dr Cunningham will talk about digital phenotyping in mental health. The webinar will cover the opportunities and challenges that digital phenotyping can deliver in mental health. Professor Ainsworth will also talk about the [Connect study](https://www.connectdigitalstudy.com/) and the [Mental Health Mission](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-use-vaccine-taskforce-model-to-tackle-health-challenges), explaining how these studies have been run and how they have successfully used smartphones and wearables to gather meaningful data. Data that may indicate if changes in activity levels, thoughts, feelings, and behaviours might relate to someone’s mental health getting better or worse. <br/> Dr James Cunningham will then go into more detail about his work, ontological approaches to digital phenotyping. He will share how an ontological approach can explain logical relationships between captured data such as links between blue-tooth proximity and sociability and how to include these links in your research results. <br/>This webinar is vital viewing for those interested in how to involve patient and public partners in study design, how to choose the right device for your study, data flow as well as how to work with patterns of missingness. |

| Speaker 1 Bio | Søren has an MSc in Exercise Science and an honours degree in health research from the University of Southern Denmark (Odense). He also has MPhil and PhD degrees in Epidemiology from the University of Cambridge. During his PhD, he developed and evaluated techniques for objective assessment of physical activity and fitness in populations, using combined accelerometry and heart rate monitoring. These and similar objective methods have now been implemented in several population studies nationally and worldwide which form the basis of the Physical Activity Epidemiology group’s work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Speaker 2 Bio | Mustafa is a research associate in health informatics at the Centre for Health Informatics. Before joining the University, he designed, monitored and evaluated public health initiatives particularly in tuberculosis and reproductive health in Pakistan for more than 10 years. During that period, he supported data-driven public health programming, by highlighting existing health inequalities in the country. At the Centre, he focuses on digital collection of patient-generated health data, and using that data to improve care and outcomes of culturally diverse people living with long-term conditions. He also works on methods to explore and address unfair and avoidable health outcomes caused or exacerbated by digital health technologies, particularly ethnic health inequities. He also works on scalable approaches for technology development and community engagement across countries with higher burden of chronic pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Overview      | One of the most contentious issues in health research using smartphones and wearables is how it may benefit some people while digitally excluding others. This month we face this topic head on. We have two expert speakers who will share the methods they employ to design digital tools for collecting patient-generated data for health research in a fair way. Dr Sabine van der Veer shares the approaches she employs to design the numerous tools she has created in kidney disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic pain. Syed Mustafa Ali then shares his experience of successfully widening participation for the Manchester Digital Pain Manikin study. He explains the methods he used to recruit people from ethnic minority backgrounds that have been traditionally underserved in health research, and conduct focus groups with them to understand their digital self-reporting needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Speaker 1 Bio | Jennifer Quint is a Professor of Respiratory Epidemiology in the School of Public Health at Imperial College London. She is an Honorary Consultant Physician in Respiratory Medicine at both the Royal Brompton Hospital and Imperial College London NHS Foundation Trust. Prof Quint leads the Respiratory Electronic Health Record group, a clinical epidemiology research group whose interests centre on using various sources of de-identified, routinely collected electronic healthcare records to study a number of respiratory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis and COVID-19. Work centres on maximising the quality, linkage and usage of these data for clinical and research purposes. Research topics include understanding the relationship between cardiovascular and respiratory disease, respiratory disease prevention, diagnosis, natural history and management. Many of the outputs are used for informing policy, and in the planning and allocation of resources. |

## Advice Clinics
Alongside each webinar you will have the opportunity to book on to an Information Governance Clinic, a Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement Clinic, and a Tech Clinic to support you as you develop your own smartphone and wearable health research project.

This is your chance to gain unique one-to-one advice with experts in their fields. This unprecedented access will allow you to discuss the specific issues holding your research back and gain practical advice on how to resolve these issues quickly and effectively.

Despite case studies of good success, patient-generated health data research is yet to deliver at scale because of many challenges. We hope that these clinics will help to fill those gaps in knowledge, skill and tools so that we can make the UK a world-leader in this field of research.
