| Speaker 2 Bio | Mustafa is a research associate in health informatics at the Centre for Health Informatics. Before joining the University, he designed, monitored and evaluated public health initiatives particularly in tuberculosis and reproductive health in Pakistan for more than 10 years. During that period, he supported data-driven public health programming, by highlighting existing health inequalities in the country. At the Centre, he focuses on digital collection of patient-generated health data, and using that data to improve care and outcomes of culturally diverse people living with long-term conditions. He also works on methods to explore and address unfair and avoidable health outcomes caused or exacerbated by digital health technologies, particularly ethnic health inequities. He also works on scalable approaches for technology development and community engagement across countries with higher burden of chronic pain. |

| Overview      | One of the most contentious issues in health research using smartphones and wearables is how it may benefit some people while digitally excluding others. This month we face this topic head on. We have two expert speakers who will share the methods they employ to design digital tools for collecting patient-generated data for health research in a fair way. Dr Sabine van der Veer shares the approaches she employs to design the numerous tools she has created in kidney disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic pain. Syed Mustafa Ali then shares his experience of successfully widening participation for the Manchester Digital Pain Manikin study. He explains the methods he used to recruit people from ethnic minority backgrounds that have been traditionally underserved in health research, and conduct focus groups with them to understand their digital self-reporting needs.                                        |

| Speaker 1 Bio | Jennifer Quint is a Professor of Respiratory Epidemiology in the School of Public Health at Imperial College London. She is an Honorary Consultant Physician in Respiratory Medicine at both the Royal Brompton Hospital and Imperial College London NHS Foundation Trust. Prof Quint leads the Respiratory Electronic Health Record group, a clinical epidemiology research group whose interests centre on using various sources of de-identified, routinely collected electronic healthcare records to study a number of respiratory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis and COVID-19. Work centres on maximising the quality, linkage and usage of these data for clinical and research purposes. Research topics include understanding the relationship between cardiovascular and respiratory disease, respiratory disease prevention, diagnosis, natural history and management. Many of the outputs are used for informing policy, and in the planning and allocation of resources. |

| Overview      | We’re thrilled to welcome our partners at Imperial College London for the third webinar in the Health Research from Home series. In this webinar attendees will hear how Professor Jennifer Quint and her team used wearable technology to discover exacerbations in COPD or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Research Fellow Dimitris Evangelopoulos then reveals how the technology they used enabled the team to examine the link between COPD and indoor/outdoor air pollution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Learning Tags    | Join us, in our second Health Research from Home webinar, for an in-depth analysis of Verily’s ‘Study Watch and Virtual Motor Exam’ clinical trial. Living with Parkinson’s disease can be cruel and painful. Through this trial, Verily worked with patients to find ways to make their journey less difficult. From conception and design, to developing and validating digital measures, to lessons learnt and future opportunities.

| Speaker | [Professor Will Dixon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-dixon-8686094a/?originalSubdomain=uk), Health Research from Home Lead|
| Speaker Bio| Will is a Professor of Digital Epidemiology at the University of Manchester, an honorary consultant rheumatologist at Salford Royal Hospital, Northern Care Alliance NHS Foundation Trust and Health Research from Home Lead. His research aims to address clinically important questions by analysing data from patient populations, with particular focus on digital health data. This includes the analysis of electronic health record data from GP surgeries and from hospitals (for example, examining the safety of drugs used in rheumatology) and the collection and analysis of data direct from patients using smartphones and wearables. Examples of innovative digital health research include Cloudy with a Chance of Pain, REMORA (Remote Monitoring of RA) and Assembling the Data Jigsaw. Will is the academic co-lead for the Greater Manchester Secure Data Environment (GM SDE). He also chairs the Scientific Advisory Board for Our Future Health and is a member of MRC's Population and Systems Medicine Board and Population Health Sciences Group.|

## Advice Clinics
Alongside each webinar you will have the opportunity to book on to an Information Governance Clinic, a Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement Clinic, and a Tech Clinic to support you as you develop your own smartphone and wearable health research project.

This is your chance to gain unique one-to-one advice with experts in their fields. This unprecedented access will allow you to discuss the specific issues holding your research back and gain practical advice on how to resolve these issues quickly and effectively.

Despite case studies of good success, patient-generated health data research is yet to deliver at scale because of many challenges. We hope that these clinics will help to fill those gaps in knowledge, skill and tools so that we can make the UK a world-leader in this field of research.
